# Sorting tasks:

## Bubblesort challenge

### Instructions

- Write the code to take an array of ints and, using the bubble sort algorithm, return the array with its elements stored in ascending order.

A good explanation of the bubblesort algorithm can be found on Wikipedia.

### Notes
Remember that the main method is supposed to only be used to start the program





## Merge Two Sorted Arrays

### Instructions

- Take two sorted arrays as input and combine them into one sorted array.

It's important to note that there are no helper methods in Java to concatenate two arrays as arguably arrays should be immutable and therefore we need
to create a new array, cycle through both arrays and add to our new array.

Notes

Attendees should start thinking about the speed at which data is processed and the need for efficient code.

Consideration should be given to the possibility that the arrays could be of different size and one or both could be of zero length.
The code should take account of this.


For both of these tasks, please test and document. Document your algorithm, how do you think this can be improved?
